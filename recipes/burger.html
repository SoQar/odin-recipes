            <li>Salt – 1 tsp (or to taste)</li>
            <li>Black pepper – ½ tsp (or to taste)</li>

            <li>Mayonnaise – 2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Ketchup – 2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Mustard – 1–2 tsp</li>
        <strong>Toppings</strong>

            <li>Tomato – 1 large, sliced</li>
            <li>Onion – ½, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>Pickles – 4–8 slices</li>
            <li>Cheese slices – 4 (cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>
        <strong>Optional Extras</strong>
            <li>Bacon strips – cooked, 4–8</li>

        <p>Start by preparing the burger patties. In a large bowl, combine ground beef 
            (about 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio) with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings you like, 
            such as garlic powder or paprika. Gently mix the meat—avoid overworking it—to keep the patties 
            tender. Shape the mixture into evenly sized rounds, slightly larger than your buns since they’ll 
            shrink during cooking. Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the patties for 
            about 3–5 minutes per side for medium, adjusting for thickness and desired doneness. If you like 
            melted cheese, add a slice of cheddar or American cheese on top during the last minute of cooking 
            and cover to let it melt.</p>
        
        <p>While the patties cook, prepare your burger buns by lightly toasting them on the grill or in a pan. 
            Assemble the burgers by spreading condiments like mayonnaise, ketchup, or mustard on the buns, 
            then layer lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and onions as desired. Place the cooked patties on 
            the buns, add any additional toppings such as crispy bacon or avocado, and finish with the top 
            bun. Serve the burgers hot alongside fries, a salad, or your favorite side dish for a classic, 
            satisfying meal.</p>
