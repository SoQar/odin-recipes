        <ul>

            <li>Lasagna noodles – 9 to 12 sheets</li>
            <li>Olive oil – 1–2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Onion – 1 medium, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Garlic – 2–3 cloves, minced</li>
            <li>
                Ground beef – 1 lb (450 g)
                (optional: half beef, half pork)
            </li>
            <li>Crushed tomatoes or marinara sauce – 24–28 oz (680–800 g)</li>
            <li>Salt – to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper – to taste</li>
            <li>Dried oregano or basil – 1–2 teaspoons</li>
        <strong>Cheese mixture</strong>
            <li>Ricotta cheese – 15 oz (425 g)</li>
            <li>Egg – 1 large</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese – ½ cup, grated</li>
        <strong>For layering & topping</strong>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese – 2 to 3 cups, shredded</li>
            <li>Extra Parmesan cheese – for topping</li>
        <strong>Optional additions:</strong>
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start by preparing a rich meat sauce. In a large skillet or saucepan, sauté finely chopped onion
             and garlic in olive oil until soft and fragrant, then add ground beef 
             (or a mix of beef and pork) and cook until browned. Drain excess fat, season with salt, 
             pepper, and a pinch of dried oregano or basil, and stir in crushed tomatoes or marinara sauce. 
             Let the sauce simmer gently for 20–30 minutes so the flavors deepen and the texture thickens 
             slightly. While the sauce cooks, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook lasagna 
             noodles until just al dente, then drain and lay them flat so they don’t stick together.</p>
        
             <p>To assemble, spread a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, then add a layer 
            of noodles, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with an egg and a bit of grated 
            Parmesan, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers—sauce, noodles, ricotta 
            mixture, mozzarella—until all ingredients are used, finishing with sauce and a generous 
            topping of mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover loosely with foil and bake in a preheated oven 
            at 375°F (190°C) for about 30 minutes, then uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until 
            the top is bubbling and lightly browned. Let the lasagna rest for at least 10 minutes before 
            slicing so the layers set and serve cleanly.</p>
