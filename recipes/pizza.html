        <h2>Home Made Stone Oven Pizza</h2>
        <ul>
        <strong>Dough</strong>
            <li>All-purpose flour – 3 ½ cups (440 g)</li>
            <li>Active dry yeast – 2 ¼ tsp (1 packet)</li>
            <li>Warm water – 1 ¼ cups (300 ml)</li>
            <li>Olive oil – 2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Sugar – 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Salt – 1 ½ tsp</li>
        <strong>Sauce</strong>
            <li>Crushed tomatoes – 1 can (14–15 oz / 400 g)</li>
            <li>Garlic – 2 cloves, minced</li>
            <li>Olive oil – 1–2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Dried oregano – 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper – to taste</li>
        <strong>Toppings</strong>
            <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese – 2 cups (200 g)</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, fresh basil, or 
                any favorite vegetables/meats</li>
        <strong>Optional finishing</strong>
            <li>Parmesan cheese – for sprinkling</li>
            <li>Olive oil – drizzle before baking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start by making the dough. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and a pinch of sugar in warm water 
            and let it sit until foamy. Stir in olive oil, salt, and flour gradually until a soft dough 
            forms, then turn it out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Place the 
            dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 
            about 1 to 1½ hours. While the dough rises, prepare a simple sauce by simmering crushed tomatoes 
            with garlic, olive oil, salt, and dried oregano or basil for a few minutes.</p>
        
        <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and stretch or roll it into a round on a floured 
            surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza stone, spread a thin layer of sauce over 
            the surface, and top with shredded mozzarella and any desired toppings such as pepperoni, 
            mushrooms, onions, or olives. Bake in a very hot oven (475–500°F / 245–260°C) until the 
            crust is golden and crisp and the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned. Let the pizza 
            cool for a minute or two before slicing, then serve hot.</p>
